# If<br/>
If freckles were lovely, and day was night,<br/>
And measles were nice and a lie warn’t a lie,<br/>
Life would be delight,—<br/>
But things couldn’t go right<br/>
For in such a sad plight<br/>
I wouldn’t be I.<br/>

If earth was heaven and now was hence,<br/>
And past was present, and false was true,<br/>
There might be some sense<br/>
But I’d be in suspense<br/>
For on such a pretense<br/>
You wouldn’t be you.<br/>

If fear was plucky, and globes were square,<br/>
And dirt was cleanly and tears were glee<br/>
Things would seem fair,—<br/>
Yet they’d all despair,<br/>
For if here was there<br/>
We wouldn’t be we.<br/>
